class Attrib:
    """Attrib: mix-in class to support attribute getting & setting.


    Each attribute name may have a setter method _set_name and/or a getter
    method _get_name.  If only the latter, it's a read-only attribute.  If
    no _set_name, attribute is set directly in self.__dict__.  This only
    applies to attribute-names that do NOT start with '_'.

    If the value being set exposes a method .assigned, it's called just
    after the attribute assignment; if the previously-set value exposes
    a method .removed, it's called just before the attribute assignment.
    This supports Models as values for widget attributes.

    Besides __setattr__ and __getattr__ special methods with this
    functionality, Attrib supplies a set method to set many attributes
    and options, and an __init__ with similar functionality.  __init__
    also handles attributes listed in self._explicit_attributes.

    Another, similar feature of class Attrib: it supplies a modattr method
    that tries to change an attribute's value in-place, if feasible, rather
    than re-bind it.  Changing in-place means trying _modify_name (rather
    than _set_name), assigning to self.name[:], and assigning to
    self.name.value.  In the end, self.name is re-bound if in-place
    modification fails.  If the value being changed exposes a method
    .modified, it's called just after an in-place modification succeeds.

    Method modify has the same interface as set (to modify potentially
    more than one attribute at once) but uses modattr rather than setattr.


    Attrib also supplies a default refresh method, which calls all the
    relevant methods named _ensure_* if flag _inhibit_refresh is false.
    In this release, all _ensure_* are called; eventually, some kind
    of mechanism will use the hints to be more selective/optimizing.
    Attrib's responsibilities include calling certain _ensure_* methods
    only once, enforcing a calling order among _ensure_* methods, and
    avoiding auto-calls of _ensure_* methods in Mixins._no_auto_ensures.


    Note that Attrib embodies two patterns (attribute setting/getting
    and refresh functionality) and is thus "Alexandrian dense"; cfr
    Vlissides, "Pattern Hatching", page 30, for pluses and minuses of
    such "dense" approaches and the resulting "profound" code.
