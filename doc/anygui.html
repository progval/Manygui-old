<h1>Anygui: Generic GUI for Python</h1>
<p class="author">Magnus Lie Hetland</p>
<p class="date">February 8th, 2002</p>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>The <em>Python</em> standard library currently does not
    contain any platform-independent GUI packages. It is the goal of
    the <em>Anygui</em> project to change this situation. There
    are many such packages available, but none has been defined as
    <em>standard</em>, so when writing GUI programs for
    <em>Python</em>, you cannot assume that your user has the
    right package installed.</p>
<p>The problem is that declaring a GUI package as standard
    would be quite controversial. There are some packages that are
    quite commonly available, such as <em>Tkinter</em>; but it
    would not be practical to require all installations to include it,
    nor would it be desirable to require all <em>Python</em> GUI
    programs to use it, since there are many programmers who prefer
    other packages.</p>
<p>
<em>Anygui</em> tries to solve this problem in a manner
    similar to the standard <code>anydbm</code> package. There is no
    need to choose <em>one</em> package at the expense of
    all others. Instead, <em>Anygui</em> gives generic access to
    several popular packages through a simple API, which makes it
    possible to write GUI applications that work with all these
    packages. Thus, one gets a platform-independent GUI module which
    is written entirely in <em>Python</em>.</p>
<p>To get the latest <em>Anygui</em> distribution, or to
    get in touch with the developers, please visit the
    <em>Anygui</em> website:
    <code><a href="http://www.anygui.org">http://www.anygui.org</a></code>.</p>
<h3>1.1 Design Goals</h3>
<p>
<b>A</b>. <em>Anygui</em> should be an easy
      to use GUI package which may be used to create simple graphical
      programs, or which may serve as the basis for more complex
      application frameworks.</p>
<p>
<b>B</b>. <em>Anygui</em> should be a pure
      <em>Python</em> package which serves as a front-end for as
      many as possible of the GUI packages available for
      <em>Python</em>, in a transparent manner.</p>
<p>
<b>C</b>. <em>Anygui</em> should include
      functionality needed to perform most GUI tasks, but should
      remain as simple and basic as possible.</p>
<h3>1.2 Warning</h3>
<p>The <em>Anygui</em> API is currently very much in flux
      as the <em>Anygui</em> team keeps experimenting with
      it. Because of that, incompatibilities may occur between
      releases. The current release (0.1.1) should be regarded
      as a prototype.</p>
<h3>1.3 Tutorial</h3>
<p>There is also a short tutorial available, which is
      included in the installation (<code>doc/tutorial.txt</code>) and
      is available from the website
      (<code><a href="http://www.anygui.org">http://www.anygui.org</a></code>).</p>
<h2>2. Installation</h2>
<p>The <em>Anygui</em> package comes in the form of a
    <code>gzip</code> compressed <code>tar</code> archive. To install
    it you will first have to uncompress the archive. On
    <em>Windows</em> this can be done with <em>WinZip</em>. in
    <em>Mac OS</em>, you can use <em>StuffIt Expander</em>. In
    <em>Unix</em>, first move to a directory where you'd like to
    put <em>Anygui</em>, and then do something like the
    following:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
foo:~/python$ tar xzvf anygui-0.1.1.tar.gz
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If your version of tar doesn't support the <code>z</code>
    switch, you can do something like this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
foo:~/python$ zcat anygui-0.1.1.tar.gz | tar xvf
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Another possibility is:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
foo:~/python$ gunzip anygui-0.1.1.tar.gz
foo:~/python$ tar -xvf anygui-0.1.1.tar
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>No matter which version you choose, you should end up with a
    directory named <code>anygui-0.1.1</code>.</p>
<h3>2.1 Running setup.py</h3>
<p>The simple way of installing <em>Anygui</em> is to use
      the installation script that's included in the
      distribution. This requires <em>Distutils</em>
      (<code><a href="http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig">http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig</a></code>), which is
      included in <em>Python</em> distributions from version
      2.0. To install the <em>Anygui</em> package in the default
      location, simply run the setup script with the
      <code>install</code> command:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
foo:~$ python setup.py install
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This will install <em>Anygui</em> in your standard
      <em>Python</em> directory structure. If you don't have
      access to this directory (e.g. because <em>Python</em> was
      installed by a sysadmin, and you don't have root access) you can
      install it somewhere else with the <code>--prefix</code>
      option:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
foo:~$ python setup.py install --prefix=${HOME}/python
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>2.2 Doing it Manually</h3>
<p>Since <em>Anygui</em> consists of only
      <em>Python</em> code, nothing needs to be compiled. And the
      only thing needed to install <em>Python</em> code is to
      ensure that the packages and modules are found by your
      <em>Python</em> interpreter. This is as simple as including
      the <code>lib</code> directory of the <em>Anygui</em>
      distribution in your <code>PYTHONPATH</code> environment
      variable. In <code>bash</code>
      (<code><a href="http://www.gnu.org/manual/bash/">http://www.gnu.org/manual/bash/</a></code>), you could do
      something like this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
foo:~$ export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/anygui/lib
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>To make this permanent, you should put it in your
      <code>.bash_profile</code> file, or something equivalent. If you
      don't want to mess around with this, and already have a standard
      directory where you place your <em>Python</em> modules, you
      can simply copy (or move) the <code>anygui</code> package (found
      in <code>anygui-0.1.1/lib</code>) there, or possibly
      place a symlink in that directory to the <code>anygui</code>
      package.</p>
<h3>2.3 Making Sure You Have a Usable GUI Package</h3>
<p>Once you have <em>Anygui</em> installed, you'll want
      to make sure you have a usable GUI package. This is easy to
      check: Simply start an interactive <em>Python</em>
      interpreter and try to execute the following:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
&gt;&gt;&gt; from anygui import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; backend()
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The <code>backend</code> function will return the name of
      the backend in use. If it is neither <code>'curses'</code> nor
      <code>'text'</code> you should be all set for making GUI
      programs with <em>Anygui</em>. (The <code>'curses'</code>
      and <code>'text'</code> backends use plain text to emulate
      graphical interfaces on platforms that don't have them.)
      <em>Anygui</em> currently supports the following
      packages:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
PythonWin  (mswgui)    <code><a href="http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/win32">http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/win32</a></code>
Tkinter    (tkgui)     <code><a href="http://www.python.org/topics/tkinter">http://www.python.org/topics/tkinter</a></code>
wxPython   (wxgui)     <code><a href="http://www.wxpython.org">http://www.wxpython.org</a></code>
Java Swing (javagui)   <code><a href="http://www.jython.org">http://www.jython.org</a></code>
PyGTK      (gtkgui)    <code><a href="http://www.daa.com.au/~james/pygtk">http://www.daa.com.au/~james/pygtk</a></code>
Bethon     (beosgui)   <code><a href="http://www.bebits.com/app/1564">http://www.bebits.com/app/1564</a></code>
PyQt       (qtgui)     <code><a href="http://www.thekompany.com/projects/pykde">http://www.thekompany.com/projects/pykde</a></code>
Curses     (cursesgui) -- used when no GUI package is available
Plain text (textgui)   -- used if curses is not available
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Add <code>gui</code> to name returned by the
      <code>backend</code> function to get the full name of the
      backend module (in the <code>anygui.backends</code>
      package). For instance, the <code>msw</code> backend is found in
      <code>anygui.backends.mswgui</code> module.</p>
<p>In general, if you end up with a text-based solution,
      <code>cursesgui</code> will be preferred over
      <code>textgui</code>if your <em>Python</em>-installation has
      a wrorking <code>curses</code> module. The exception is if you
      are using <em>Anygui</em> in the interactive interpreter, in
      which <code>textgui</code> will be preferred, to avoid
      interfering with the terminal and locking up the interpreter
      prompt. (If you'd like to, for some reason, you can override
      this behaviour with the environment variable
      <code>ANYGUI_FORCE_CURSES</code>; see the API Reference
      below.)</p>
<p>
<b>BeOS Note:</b> The BeOS backend
      (<code>beosgui</code>) is currently not fully functional, but is
      included nonetheless.</p>
<p>Of these, <em>Tkinter</em> is compiled in by default
      in the <em>MS Windows</em> distribution of
      <em>Python</em> (available from
      <code><a href="http://www.python.org">http://www.python.org</a></code>), <em>PythonWin</em> (as
      well as <em>Tkinter</em>) is included in the
      <em>ActiveState</em> distribution, <em>ActivePython</em>
      (available from <code><a href="http://www.activestate.com">http://www.activestate.com</a></code>), and
      <em>Java Swing</em> is automatically available in
      <em>Jython</em>, the <em>Java</em> implementation of
      <em>Python</em>.</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> In <em>Mac OS</em> 9,
      <em>Anygui</em> (using <em>Tkinter</em>) works with with
      <em>Python Classic</em> and recent versions of <em>Python
      Carbon</em>, but older versions have problems with
      <em>Tkinter</em>.</p>
<h2>3. Using Anygui</h2>
<p>
<em>Note</em>: For some examples of working
    <em>Anygui</em> code, see the <code>test</code> and
    <code>demo</code> directories of the distribution. Remember that
    the test scripts are written to test certain features of
    <em>Anygui</em>, not to represent recommended coding
    practices.</p>
<p>Using <em>Anygui</em> is simple; it's simply a matter of
    importing the classes and functions you need from the
    <code>anygui</code> module, e.g.:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
from anygui import *
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>After doing this you must create an <code>Application</code>
    object, at least one <code>Window</code>, and probably a few
    components such as <code>Button</code>s and
    <code>TextField</code>s. The <code>Window</code>s are added to the
    <code>Application</code> (through its <code>add</code> method),
    and the various components are added to the
    <code>Window</code>. When you have done this, you call the
    <code>run</code> method of your <code>Application</code>
    instance.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
# Make components here
win = Window()
# Add components to the Window
app = Application()
app.add(win)
app.run()
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>3.1 Avoiding Namespace Pollution</h3>
<p>Importing everything from <em>Anygui</em> (as in
      <code>from anygui import *</code>) is fine for small programs,
      where you're certain that there will be no name clashes. You may
      also simply import the names you need:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
from anygui import Application, Window
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The preferred way to use modules like this is usually to
      avoid cluttering your namespace, by using simply
      <code>import anygui</code>. However, if you are going to create a lot of
      widgets, the <code>anygui</code> prefix may be
      cumbersome. Therefore, I suggest renaming it to
      <code>gui</code>, either with a simple assignment...</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
import anygui; gui = anygui
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>... or, in recent versions of <em>Python</em>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
import anygui as gui
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Then you can instantiate widgets like this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
win = gui.Window()
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The examples in this documentation use the starred import,
      for simplicity.</p>
<h3>3.2 Importing the Backends Directly</h3>
<p>If you wish to import a backend directly (and "hardwire
      it" into your program), you may do so. For instance, if you
      wanted to use the <em>wxPython</em> backend,
      <code>wxgui</code>, you'd replace
      </p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
from anygui import *
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>with</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
from anygui.backends.wxgui import *
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This way you may use <em>Anygui</em> in standalone
      executables built with tools like <code>py2exe</code>
      (<code><a href="http://starship.python.net/crew/theller/py2exe/">http://starship.python.net/crew/theller/py2exe/</a></code>) or
      the McMillan installer
      (<code><a href="http://www.mcmillan-inc.com/install1.html">http://www.mcmillan-inc.com/install1.html</a></code>), or with
      <code>jythonc</code> with the <code>--deep</code> option or
      equivalent.</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> Compiling <code>jar</code> files of
      <em>Anygui</em> programs with <em>Jython</em> may not
      work in the current version.</p>
<p>Note that the namespace handling still works just fine:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
import anygui.backends.tkgui as gui
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>3.3 Creating a Window</h3>
<p>One of the most important classes in <em>Anygui</em>
      is <code>Window</code>. Without a <code>Window</code> you have
      no GUI; all the other widgets are added to
      <code>Window</code>s. Knowing this, we may suspect that the
      following is a minimal <em>Anygui</em> program (and we would
      be right):</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
from anygui import *
app = Application()
win = Window()
app.add(win)
app.run()
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This example gives us a rather uninteresting default
      window. You may customise it by setting some of its properties,
      like <code>title</code> and <code>size</code>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
w = Window()
w.title = 'Hello, world!'
w.size = (200, 100)
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If we want to, we can supply the widget properties as
      keyword arguments to the constructor:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
w = Window(title='Hello, world!', size=(200,100))
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>3.4 The set Method and the Options Class</h3>
<p>If you want to change some attributes of a widget, you can
      either just set them directly, or (if you'd like to set several
      at once), use the <code>set</code> method, just like the
      constructor:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
w.set(title='Hello, again', size=(300,200))
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Supplying the same attributes with the same values to a
      lot of widgets (if you are making several buttons with the same
      size, for instance) can be a bit impractical (you'll learn more
      about buttons in a little while):</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
bt1 = Button(left=10, width=50, height=30, text='Button 1')
bt2 = Button(left=10, width=50, height=30, text='Button 2')
bt3 = Button(left=10, width=50, height=30, text='Button 3')
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>To deal with this, the widget constructors (and the
      <code>set</code> method) can take <code>Options</code> objects
      as positional parameters:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
opt = Options(left=10, width=50, height=30)
bt1 = Button(opt, text='Button 1')
bt2 = Button(opt, text='Button 2')
bt3 = Button(opt, text='Button 3')
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>As you can see, this saves quite a lot of typing. You can
      use as many <code>Options</code> arguments as you like.</p>
<h3>3.5 The modify Method</h3>
<p>Just like <code>set</code> can be used to set the
      attributes of a <code>Component</code>, the <code>modify</code>
      method can be used to <em>modify</em> them, without
      rebinding them to another value. To show the difference,
      consider the following example (where <code>foo</code> is an
      attribute that does nothing special):</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
&gt;&gt;&gt; from anygui import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; btn = Button()
&gt;&gt;&gt; some_list = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; btn.foo = some_list
&gt;&gt;&gt; btn.modify(foo=[4, 5, 6])
&gt;&gt;&gt; btn.foo
[4, 5, 6]
&gt;&gt;&gt; some_list
[4, 5, 6]
&gt;&gt;&gt; btn.set(foo=[7, 8, 9])
&gt;&gt;&gt; btn.foo
[7, 8, 9]
&gt;&gt;&gt; some_list
[4, 5, 6]
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>As you can see, using <code>modify</code> modifies the
      list, while <code>set</code> replaces it. The
      <code>modify</code> method is used for (among other things)
      implementing Model-View-Controller systems. (More about that
      later.)</p>
<p>The <code>modify</code> method works as follows: If there
      is a specific internal method for modifying an attribute, that
      is called. Otherwise, the supplied value will be assigned to
      <code>self.name[:]</code> (where <code>name</code> is the
      attribute in question). If that doesn't work (a
      <code>TypeError</code> exception is raised), the value will be
      assigned to <code>self.name.value</code>. If that doesn't work
      either, the attribute will be rebound to the new value, with the
      same result as using <code>set</code>. So, to avoid any in-place
      modification, all you need to do is use immutable values:
      </p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
&gt;&gt;&gt; from anygui import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; btn = Button()
&gt;&gt;&gt; some_list = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; btn.foo = tuple(some_list)
&gt;&gt;&gt; btn.modify(foo=[4, 5, 6])
&gt;&gt;&gt; btn.foo
[4, 5, 6]
&gt;&gt;&gt; some_list
[1, 2, 3]
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>3.6 The refresh Method</h3>
<p>The <code>modify</code> method is used to modify
      attributes in-place, e.g. to keep them in sync with a
      widget. This is done automatically when you change a widget
      through the graphical interface. In a way, the
      <code>refresh</code> method works the other way: If you modify an
      attribute, you can call the <code>refresh</code> method to keep
      the widget's appearance in sync with its state. When you assign
      to an attribute, <code>refresh</code> is called automatically;
      you only have to call it yourself if you have an attribute which
      is a mutable object, and you modify that object.</p>
<p>For more info about the use of <code>refresh</code>, see
      the section "About Models, Views, and Controllers",
      below.</p>
<h3>3.7 Adding a Label</h3>
<p>Simple labels are created with the <code>Label</code>
      class:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
lab = Label(text='Hello, again!', position=(10,10))
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Here we have specified a position just for fun; we don't
      really have to. If we add the label to our window, we'll see
      that it's placed with its left topmost corner at the point
      <code>(10,10)</code>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
w.add(lab)
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>3.8 Layout: Placing Widgets in a Frame</h3>
<p>This section goves a simple example of positioning
      <code>Components</code>; for more information about the
      <em>Anygui</em> layout mechanism, please refer to the API
      Reference (below).</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
win.add(lab, position=(10,10))
win.add(lab, left=10, top=10)
win.add(lab, top=10, right=10)
win.add(lab, position=(10,10), right=10, hstretch=1)
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In the last example <code>hstretch</code> is a Boolean
      value indicating whether the widget should be stretched
      horizontally (to maintain the other specifications) when the
      containing <code>Frame</code> is resized. (The vertical version
      is <code>vstretch</code>.)</p>
<p>Just like in component constructors, you can use
      <code>Options</code> objects in the <code>add</code> method,
      after the component to be added:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
win.add(lab, opt, left=10)
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<h4>3.8.1 Placing More Than One Widget</h4>
<p>The <code>add</code> method can also position a
	<em>sequence</em> of widgets. The first widget
	will be placed as before, while the subsequent ones will be
	placed either to the <code>right</code>, to the
	<code>left</code>, above (<code>up</code>), or below
	(<code>down</code>), according to the <code>direction</code>
	argument, at a given distance (<code>space</code>):</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
win.add((lab1, lab2), position=(10,10),
        direction='right', space=10)
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> Remember to enclose your
	components in a sequence (such as a tuple or a list), since
	<code>add</code> allows you to use more positional arguments,
	but will treat them differently. If you want to use
	<code>Options</code> objects, place them outside (after) the
	sequence. For more information see the section about the
	<code>Frame</code> class in the API Reference below.</p>
<h3>3.9 Buttons and Event Handling</h3>
<p>
<code>Buttons</code> (as most components) work more or
      less the same way as <code>Labels</code>. You can set their
      <code>size</code>, their <code>position</code>, their
      <code>text</code>, etc. and then <code>add</code> them to a
      <code>Frame</code> (such as a <code>Window</code>). The thing
      that makes them interesting is that they emit
      <em>events</em>. Each time the user clicks a button,
      it sends out a <code>click</code> event. You can catch these
      events by linking your button to one or more <em>event
      handlers</em>. It's really simple:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
btn = Button(text='Greet Environment')
def greeting(**args):
    print 'Hello, World!'
link(btn, greeting)
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The event handling is taken care of by the call to
      <code>link</code>. An event handler may receive several keyword
      arguments, and if you're not particularly interested in any of
      them, simply use something like <code>**args</code> above. (For
      more information about this, see the section about global
      functions in the API Reference below.)</p>
<h3>3.10 About Models, Views, and Controllers</h3>
<p>The <em>Anygui</em> MVC mechanism (based on the
      <code>refresh</code> method and the <code>Assignee</code>
      protocol) is described in the API Reference below. Here is a
      short overview on how to use it.</p>
<p>A <em>model</em> is an object that can be
      modified, and that can notify other objects, called
      <code>views</code>, when it has been modified. A
      <em>controller</em> is an object that can modify the
      model, in particular as a direct response to a user action (such
      as clicking the mouse or typing some text). In
      <em>Anygui</em>, <code>Component</code>s double as both
      views (showing a model's state to the user) and controllers
      (letting the user modify the model). Even though
      <em>Anygui</em> supports using models this way, you can also
      create complete application without using them.</p>
<p>Models are in general instances of some subclass of the
      <code>Model</code> class, although they don't have to be; see
      the API Reference below for a description of how they work. (The
      <code>Model</code> class is currently internal to the
      <code>Anygui</code> package, but it can be found int he
      <code>anygui.Models</code> module.) The <code>Model</code>s that
      are included in <em>Anygui</em> are:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
BooleanModel     -- represents a Boolean value
ListModel        -- behaves like a list
NumberModel      -- represents a numerical value
TextModel        -- acts like a mutable string
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>These all have a <code>value</code> attribute which may be
      used to change their internal value. They also support other
      operations, such as indexing and slicing etc. for
      <code>ListModel</code>. These are very easy to use: Just assign
      them to an attribute of a <code>Component</code>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
# You'll learn about CheckBoxes in a minute
cbx = CheckBox(text='Simple model test')
state = BooleanModel(value=1)
cbx.on = state
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Now, if you change <code>state</code> (e.g. with the
      statement <code>state.value=0</code>) this will automatically be
      reflected in the <code>CheckBox</code> (which will be acting
      like a view). If the user clicks the <code>CheckBox</code>, the
      model will be changed.</p>
<p>To keep a view up-to-date manually you can call its
      <code>refresh</code> method. This can be useful if you use a
      simple (non-<code>Model</code>) mutable value such as a list in
      an attribute:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
btn = Button()
rect = [0, 0, 10, 10]
btn.geometry = rect
rect[3] = 20
btn.refresh()
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>After modifying <code>rect</code>, the button will not
      have changed, since it can't detect the change by
      itself. (That's only possible when you use a real model.)
      Therefore, you call <code>btn.refresh</code> to tell it to update
      itself.</p>
<p>If you assign a value to an attribute, the
      <code>refresh</code> method will be called automatically, so
      another way of doing the same thing is:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
btn = Button()
rect = [0, 0, 10, 10]
btn.geometry = rect
rect[3] = 20
btn.geometry = rect
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
<b>Warning:</b> Because of the controller behaviour
      of <code>Component</code>s, if the <code>Button</code> is
      resized, <code>rect</code> will be modified. If you don't want
      this behaviour, use a tuple instead of a list, since tuples
      can't be modified.</p>
<p>If you want another object to monitor a model, you can
      simply use the <code>link</code> method, since all models
      generate an event (of the type <code>default</code>) when they
      are modified.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
from anygui import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; mdl = BooleanModel()
&gt;&gt;&gt; mdl.value = 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; def model_changed(**kw):
&gt;&gt;&gt;     print 'The model has changed!'

&gt;&gt;&gt; link(mdl, model_changed)
&gt;&gt;&gt; mdl.value = 0
The model has changed
&gt;&gt;&gt; mdl.value = 0
The model has changed
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note the last two lines: We haven't really changed the
      model, but the event handler is called nonetheless. If you want
      to know whether the model really changed, you must retain a copy
      of its state, and compare the new value.</p>
<h3>3.11 Using CheckBoxes</h3>
<p>A <code>CheckBox</code> is a <em>toggle
      button</em>, a button which can be in one of two states,
      "on" or "off". Except for that, it works more or less like any
      other button in that you can place it, set its text, and
      link an event handler to it.</p>
<p>Whether a <code>CheckBox</code> is currently on or off is
      indicated by its <code>on</code> attribute.</p>
<h3>3.12 RadioButtons and RadioGroups</h3>
<p>
<code>RadioButton</code>s are toggle buttons, just like
      <code>CheckBox</code>es. The main differences are that they look
      slightly different, and that they should belong to a
      <code>RadioGroup</code>.</p>
<p>A <code>RadioGroup</code> is a set of
      <code>RadioButton</code>s where only <em>one</em><code>RadioButton</code> is permitted to be "on" at one
      time. Thus, when one of the buttons in the group is turned on,
      the others are automatically turned off. This can be useful for
      selecting among different alternatives.</p>
<p>
<code>RadioButton</code>s are added to a
      <code>RadioGroup</code> by setting their <code>group</code>
      property:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
radiobutton.group = radiogroup
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This may also be done when constructing the button:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
grp = RadioGroup()
rbn = RadioButton(group=grp)
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> The behaviour of a
      <code>RadioButton</code> when it does not belong to a
      <code>RadioGroup</code> is not defined by the
      <em>Anygui</em> API, and may vary across backend. Basically,
      a <code>RadioButton</code> without a <code>RadioGroup</code> is
      meaningless; use a <code>CheckBox</code> instead.</p>
<p>
<code>RadioGroups</code> also support an <code>add</code>
      method, as all other <em>Anygui</em> container-like
      objects:</p>
<p>
<code><b>add</b></code>(<i>button</i>)</p>
<p>Adds the <i>button</i> to the group, including setting
      <i>button</i><code>.group</code> to the group. As with the
      other <code>add</code> methods, the argument may be either a
      single object, or a sequence of objects.</p>
<h3>3.13 ListBox</h3>
<p>A <code>ListBox</code> is a vertical list of items that
      can be selected, either by clicking on them, or by moving the
      selection up and down with the arrow keys. (For the arrow keys
      to work, you must make sure that the <code>ListBox</code> has
      keyboard focus. In some backends this requires using the
      <code>tab</code> key.)</p>
<p>
<em>Note</em>: When using <em>Anygui</em>
      with <em>Tkinter</em>, using the arrow keys won't change the
      selection, only which item is underlined. You'll have to use the
      arrow keys until the item you want to select is underlined; then
      select it by pressing the space bar.</p>
<p>A <code>ListBox</code>'s items are stored in its attribute
      <code>items</code>, a sequence of arbitrary objects. The
      text displayed in the widget will be the result of applying the
      built-in <em>Python</em> function <code>str</code> to each
      object.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
lbx = ListBox()
lbx.items = 'This is a test'.split()
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The currently selected item can be queried or set through
      the <code>selection</code> property (an integer index, counting
      from zero). Also, when an item is selected, a
      <code>select</code> event is generated, which is the default
      event type for a <code>ListBox</code>. This means that you can
      either do</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
link(lbx, 'select', handler)
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>or</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
link(lbx, handler)
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>with the same result. (This is similar to the
      <code>click</code> event, which is default for
      <code>Buttons</code>; for more information, see the API
      Reference below.)</p>
<h3>3.14 TextField and TextArea</h3>
<p>
<em>Anygui</em>'s two text widgets,
      <code>TextField</code> and <code>TextArea</code> are quite
      similar. The difference between them is that
      <code>TextField</code> permits neither newlines or tab
      characters to be typed, while <code>TextArea</code> does. Typing
      a tab in a <code>TextField</code> will simply move the focus to
      another widget, while pressing the enter key will send an
      <code>enterkey</code> event (which is the
      <code>TextField</code>'s default event type).</p>
<p>The text in a text component is stored in its
      <code>text</code> property (a string or equivalent), and the
      current selection is stored in its <code>selection</code>
      property (a tuple of two integer indices).</p>
<h3>3.15 Making Your Own Components and LayoutManagers</h3>
<p>Currently, you can create your own components by combining
      others in <code>Frame</code>s, and wrapping the whole thing up
      as a class. One of the main reasons for doing this would be to
      emulate a feature (such as a tabbed pane) available in some
      backends, but not in others. One could then actually
      <em>use</em> the native version in the backends
      where it is available (such as <code>wx</code>, in this case),
      and use the "emulation" in the others. There is some limited
      support for this in the <code>backend</code> function (which
      will allow you to check whether you are currently using the
      correct backend), but in the future, a more complete API will be
      developed for this, allowing you access to the coolest features
      of your favorite GUI package, while staying "package
      independent".</p>
<p>You can already create your own layout managers, by
      properly supporting the methods <code>add</code>,
      <code>remove</code>, and <code>resized</code>. The simplest way
      of doing this is to subclass <code>LayoutManager</code>, which
      gives you the <code>add</code> and <code>remove</code> methods
      for free. You can then concentrate on the method
      <code>resized</code> which takes two positional arguments,
      <code>dw</code>, and <code>dh</code> (change in width and change
      in height) and is responsible for changing the geometries of all
      the components in the <code>Frame</code> the
      <code>LayoutManager</code> is managing. (This frame is available
      through the private attribute <code>self._container</code>.)
      </p>
<p>To get more control over things, you should probably also
      override the two internal methods <code>add_components</code>
      and <code>remove_component</code>:</p>
<p>
<code>add_components</code>(self, *<i>items</i>,
      **<i>kws</i>)</p>
<p>Should add all the components in <i>items</i>, and
      associate them with the options in <code>kws</code>, for later
      resizing.</p>
<p>
<code>remove_component</code>(self,
      <i>item</i>)</p>
<p>Should remove the given item.</p>
<h2>4. API Reference</h2>
<p>The following reference describes the full official API of
    the current version (0.1.1) of <em>Anygui</em>.</p>
<h3>4.1 Environment Variables</h3>
<p>Some environment variables affect the behaviour of the
      <em>Anygui</em> package. These must be set in the
      environment of the program using <em>Anygui</em>. They may
      either be set permanently through normal operating system
      channels (check your OS documentation for this), or possibly
      just set temporarily when running your program. In
      <em>Unix</em> shells like <em>bash</em>, you can set the
      variables on the command line before your comand, like this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
foo:~$ ANYGUI_SOMEVAR='some value' python someprogram.py
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>where <code>ANYGUI_SOMEVAR</code> is some environment
      variable used by <em>Anygui</em>.</p>
<p>Since <em>Jython</em> doesn't support OS environment
      variables, you'll have to supply them with the command-line
      switch <code>-D</code>: </p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
foo:~$ jython -DANYGUI_SOMEVAR='some value' someprogram.py
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>You can also set these environment variables in your own
      program, by using code like the following before you import
      <em>Anygui</em>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
import os
os.environ['ANYGUI_SOMEVAR'] = 'some value'
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This will probably not work well in <em>Jython</em>, though.</p>
<p>The environment variables used by <em>Anygui</em>
      are:</p>
<p>
<code>ANYGUI_WISHLIST</code>: A whitespace separated list
      of backend names in the order you wish for <em>Anygui</em>
      to try to use them. The backends are identified with a short
      prefix such as <code>wx</code> for <code>wxgui</code>, or
      <code>tk</code> for <code>tkgui</code>. For a full list of
      available backends, see the section "Making Sure You Have a GUI
      Backend" above. Only the backends in this list will be tried; if
      you don't set <code>ANYGUI_WISHLIST</code>, then the following
      is the default:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
'msw gtk java wx tk beos qt curses text'
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you insert an asterisk in the wishlist, it will be
      interpreted as "the rest of the backends, in default order". So,
      for instance,</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
ANYGUI_WISHLIST='tk wx * text curses'
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>is equivalent to</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
ANYGUI_WISHLIST='tk wx msq gtk java beos qt text curses'
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Example:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
foo:~$ ANYGUI_WISHLIST='tk wx qt' python someprogram.py
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
<code>ANYGUI_DEBUG</code>: When <em>Anygui</em> tries
      to import a backend, it hides all exceptions, assuming they are
      caused by the fact that a given backend doesn't work in your
      installation (because you don't have it installed or something
      similar). However, at times this may not be the reason; it may
      simple be that a given backend contains a bug. To track down the
      bug, set the <code>ANYGUI_WISHLIST</code> to some true (in a
      <em>Python</em> sense) value. (If the value supplied can be
      converted to an integer, it will. Otherwise, it will be treated
      as a string.) This will make <em>Anygui</em> print out the
      stack traces from each backend it tries to import.</p>
<p>There is one exception to this rule: If the true value
      supplied is the name of one of the backends (such as
      <code>tk</code> or <code>curses</code>) only the traceback
      caused by importing that backend will be shown. This can be
      useful to make the output somewhat less verbose.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
foo:~$ ANYGUI_DEBUG=1 python someprogram.py
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
<code>ANYGUI_ALTERNATE_BORDER</code>: This Boolean
      variable affects <code>cursesgui</code>, making it use the same
      border-drawing characters as <code>textgui</code>
      (<code>'+'</code>, <code>'-'</code>, and <code>'|'</code>). This
      may be useful if your terminal can't show the special
      <code>curses</code> box-drawing characters properly.</p>
<p>
<code>ANYGUI_SCREENSIZE</code>: Affects
      <code>textgui</code>. Gives the terminal ("screen") dimensions,
      in characters. This should be in the format
      <i>width</i><code>x</code><i>height</i>,
      e.g. <code>80x24</code>. If this environment variable is not
      supplied, the standard <em>Unix</em> variables
      <code>COLUMNS</code> and <code>LINES</code> will be used. If
      neither is provided, the default size <code>80x23</code> will be
      used.</p>
<p>
<code>ANYGUI_FORCE_CURSES</code>: Normally,
      <code>cursesgui</code> will not be selected if you are in the
      interactive interpreter. If you want to force the normal
      selection order (trying to use <code>cursesgui</code> before
      resorting to <code>textgui</code>) you can set this variable to
      a true value. Note that this is not the same as setting
      <code>ANYGUI_WISHLIST</code> to <code>'curses'</code>, since
      that will ignore all other backends.</p>
<p>
<code>ANYGUI_CURSES_NOHELP</code>: If you don't want the
      help-screen that appears when an <em>Anygui</em> application
      is started using <code>cursesgui</code> (or
      <code>textgui</code>), you can set this variable to a true
      value.</p>
<h3>4.2 Global Functions</h3>
<p>
<code><b>application</b></code>()</p>
<p>Returns the current <code>Application</code>
      object.</p>
<p>
<code><b>backend</b></code>()</p>
<p>Returns the name (as used in <code>ANYGUI_WISHLIST</code>)
      of the backend currently in use.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
if backend() == 'wx':
    some_wx_code()
else:
    some_generic_code()
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
<code><b>link</b></code>(<i>source</i>,
      [<i>event</i>,] <i>handler</i>, <i>weak</i>=0,
      <i>loop</i>=0)</p>
<p>Creates a link in the <em>Anygui</em> event system,
      between the <code>source</code> (any object) and the
      <code>handler</code> (any callable, or a <code>(obj,func)</code>
      pair, where <code>func</code> is an unbound method or function,
      and <code>obj</code> is an object which will be supplied as the
      first parameter to <code>func</code>). Supplying an
      <code>event</code> (a string) will make the link carry only
      information about events of that type. If no event is supplied,
      <code>'default'</code> will be assumed. Setting
      <code>weak</code> to a true value will use weak references when
      setting up the link, so that no objects will be "kept alive" by
      the link.</p>
<p>A send-loop occurs if an object sends an event "to itself"
      (i.e. it is the <code>source</code> argument of a call to
      <code>send</code> which hasn't returned at the point where one
      of its methods are about to be activated as a handler). The
      truth value <code>loop</code> decides whether this handler will
      be activated in such a loop. (If <code>send</code> was called
      with <code>loop=1</code>, loops will be allowed anyway.)
      </p>
<p>Note that <code>source</code>, <code>event</code>, and
      <code>handler</code> are strictly positional parameters, while
      the others (<code>weak</code>, and <code>loop</code>) must be
      supplied as keyword parameters.</p>
<p>Sometimes one might want an event handler that reacts to a
      specific event from <em>any</em> source, or
      <em>any</em> event from a specific source; or even
      <em>any</em> event from <em>any</em>
      source. To do that, simply use the special value
      <code>any</code> as either source, event, or both.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
from anygui import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; def monitor_events(event, **kw):
...     print 'An event occurred:', event
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; link(any, any, monitor_events)
&gt;&gt;&gt; btn = Button()
&gt;&gt;&gt; send(btn, 'foobar')
An event occurred: foobar
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you use <code>send(btn, 'click')</code> in this
      example, you will get <em>two</em> events, since the
      <code>Button</code> will detect the <code>click</code> event
      (which is its default), and issue a <code>default</code> event
      as well.</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> You need to explicitly supply the
      event type if you want to respond to any event type; otherwise
      you will only respond to the <code>default</code> type.</p>
<p>Event handlers that react to the same event will be called
      in the order they were registered (with <code>link</code>),
      subject to the following: (1) All handlers registered with a
      specific source will be called before handlers with the value
      <code>any</code> as source; (2) all handlers registered with a
      specific event (including <code>default</code>) are called
      before handlers with the value <code>any</code> as event.</p>
<p>For more information on sending events, see
      <code>send</code>, below.</p>
<p>
<code><b>send</b></code>(<i>source</i>,
      <i>event</i>=<code>'default'</code>, <i>loop</i>=0,
      **<i>kwds</i>)</p>
<p>When this is called, any handlers (callables) linked to
      the source, but which will not cause a send-loop (unless
      <code>loop</code> is true) will be called with all the keyword
      arguments provided (except <code>loop</code>), in the order in
      which they were linked. In addition to the supplied keyword
      arguments, the event framework will add <code>source</code>,
      <code>event</code>, and the time (as measured by the standard
      <em>Python</em> function <code>time.time</code>) when
      <code>send</code> was called, supplied with the
      <code>time</code> argument.
      </p>
<p>Note that <code>source</code>, and <code>event</code>, are
      strictly positional parameters, while the others
      (<code>loop</code>, and any additional arguments the user might
      add) must be supplied as keyword parameters.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
# Link an event handler to a button, and then manually send a
# default event from the button. This event would have been
# sent automatically if we clicked the button. Note that we
# only use the arguments we need, and lump the rest in **kw.

def click(source, time, **kw):
    print 'Button %s clicked at %f.' % (source.text, time)

btn = Button(text='Click me')
link(btn, click)

send(btn) # Fake a button click -- will call click()
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>For information about the order in which event handlers
      are called, see <code>link</code>, above.</p>
<p>
<b>Important:</b> Due to the current semantics
      of the <code>any</code> value, using it in <code>send</code> may
      not be a good idea, since the result might not be what you
      expect. For instance, calling <code>send(any, any)</code> will
      only activate event handlers which have been linked to the value
      <code>any</code> as both source and event, not to "event
      handlers with any source and any event". This may change in
      future releases. The current behaviour of <code>send</code> with
      <code>any</code> is consistent with <code>unlink</code>.</p>
<p>
<code><b>unlink</b></code>(<i>source</i>,
      [<i>event</i>,] <i>handler</i>)</p>
<p>Undoes a call to <code>link</code> with the same
      positional arguments. If <i>handler</i> has been registered
      with either <i>source</i> or <i>event</i> as
      <code>any</code>, that parameter will be irrelevant when
      deciding whether or not to remove that link. For instance:
      </p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
link(foo, any, bar)
unlink(foo, baz, bar)
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Here the link created by <code>link(foo, any, bar)</code>
      will be removed by the call to <code>unlink</code>.</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> This behaviour (unlinking handlers
      registered with the <code>any</code> value) may change in future
      releases.</p>
<p>
<b>Default Events</b>: When used without the
      event argument, both <code>link</code> and <code>send</code> use
      an event type called <code>default</code>. Most event-generating
      components have a default event type, such as <code>click</code>
      for <code>Button</code>s. The fact that this event type is
      default for <code>Button</code> means that when a
      <code>Button</code> generates a <code>click</code> event it will
      <em>also</em> generate a <code>default</code>
      event. So, if you listen to both <code>click</code> events and
      <code>default</code> events from a <code>Button</code>, your
      event handler will always be called twice.</p>
<p>
<code><b>unlinkHandler</b></code>(<i>handler</i>)</p>
<p>Removes a handler completely from the event
      framework.</p>
<p>
<code><b>unlinkMethods</b></code>(<i>obj</i>)</p>
<p>Unlinks all handlers that are methods of
      <code>obj</code>.</p>
<p>
<code><b>unlinkSource</b></code>(<i>source</i>)</p>
<p>Remove the source (and all handlers linked to it) from the
      event framework.</p>
<h3>4.3 Classes</h3>
<p>
<b>Base Classes and Common Behaviour</b>
</p>
<p>All components are subclasses of corresponding abstract
      components which implement behaviour common to all the
      backends. So, for instance, <code>Button</code> subclasses
      <code>AbstractButton</code>. These abstract components, again,
      subclass <code>AbstractComponent</code>, which implements
      behaviour common to all components.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important behaviour is attribute handling
      (inherited from the <code>Attrib</code> mixin), which means that
      setting a components attributes may trigger some internal method
      calls. For instance,</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
win.size = 300, 200
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>will automatically resize the component
      <code>win</code>. Attributes common to all components are:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
x         -- x-coordinate of upper left corner
y         -- y-coordinate of upper left corner
position  -- equivalent to (x, y)
width     -- component width
height    -- component height
size      -- equivalent to (width, height)
geometry  -- equivalent to (x, y, width, height)
visible   -- whether the component is visible
enabled   -- whether the component is enabled
text      -- text associated with the component
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>These can all be set as keyword arguments to the component
      constructors. Also, <code>Options</code> objects (with similar
      constructors) can be used as positional arguments in the
      constructor, with all the <code>Options</code>'s attributes
      being set in the component as well.</p>
<p>Common to <code>Application</code>, <code>Window</code>,
      and <code>Frame</code> is the <code>contents</code> attribute,
      as well as the <code>add</code> and <code>remove</code>
      methods. These will be described with the individual classes
      below.</p>
<p>All <code>Attrib</code> subclasses (including components,
      <code>Application</code>, and <code>RadioGroup</code>) share the
      following methods:</p>
<p>
<code><b>set</b></code>(*<i>args</i>, **<i>kwds</i>)</p>
<p>Used to set attributes. Works like the <code>Attrib</code>
      constructor, setting attributes, and optionally using
      <code>Options</code> objects.</p>
<p>
<code><b>modify</b></code>(*<i>args</i>, **<i>kwds</i>)</p>
<p>Works like the <code>set</code> method, except that the
      attributes are modified <em>in place</em>. That
      means the following (for an attribute named <code>foo</code>):
      (1) If there exists an internal method (implemented in
      <em>Anygui</em>) for modifying the attribute inplace (called
      <code>_modify_foo</code>), use that; otherwise (2) try to use
      slice assignment to change the value (will work for lists and
      <code>ListModels</code> etc.); if that doesn't work, (3) assign
      to the value's <code>value</code> attribute (used to modify
      <code>Model</code>s. If neither of these approaches work, simply
      rebind the attribute (equivalent to using the <code>set</code>
      method).</p>
<p>As with <code>set</code> and ordinary attribute
      assignment, the <code>refresh</code> method will automatically be
      called when you use <code>modify</code>.</p>
<p>
<code><b>refresh</b></code>()</p>
<p>When an attribute of a <code>Component</code> (or
      <code>Application</code>, <code>RadioGroup</code>, or an
      instance of another <code>Attrib</code> subclass) is assigned a
      value, the <code>Component</code> is automatically updated to
      reflect its new state. For instance, if you have a
      <code>Label</code><code>lbl</code>, assigning a value to
      <code>lbl.geometry</code> would immediately change the
      <code>Label</code>'s geometry, and assigning to
      <code>lbl.text</code> would change its text.</p>
<p>This is good enough for most cases, but sometimes an
      attribute can contain a mutable value, such as a list, and
      changing that will not update the <code>Component</code>. For
      instance, if you use a list to hold the <code>items</code> of a
      <code>ListBox</code>, you could end up in the following
      situation:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
lbx = ListBox()
lbx.items = 'first second third'.split()
# More code...
lbx.items.append('fourth')
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>After performing this code, nothing will have happened to
      the <code>ListBox</code>, because it has no way of knowing that
      the list has changed. To fix that, you can simply call its
      <code>refresh</code> method:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
lbx.refresh()
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This method checks whether any attributes have changed,
      and make sure that the <code>Component</code> us up to
      date.</p>
<p>
<b>Updating Automatically</b>
</p>
<p>Updating <code>Components</code> explicitly can be useful,
      but sometimes you would want it to be done for you,
      automatically, each time you modify an object that is referred
      to by a <code>Component</code> attribute. This can be taken care
      of by <code>link</code> and <code>send</code>. If your object
      uses <code>send</code> every time it's modified, and you
      <code>link</code> the object to your <code>Component</code>'s
      <code>refresh</code> method, things will happen by
      themselves:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
class TriggerList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.list = []
    def append(self, obj):
        self.list.append(obj)
        send(self)
    def __getitem__(self, i):
        return self.list[i]

lbx = ListBox()
lbx.items = TriggerList()
link(lbx.items, lbx.refresh)
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Now, if we call <code>lbx.items.append('fourth')</code>,
      <code>lbx.refresh</code> will automatically be called. To make
      your life easier, <em>Anygui</em> already contains some
      classes that send signals whend they are modified; these classes
      are called <code>Model</code>s.</p>
<p>
<b>Model and Assignee</b>
</p>
<p>The <em>Anygui</em> models (<code>BooleanModel</code>,
      <code>ListModel</code>, <code>TextModel</code>, and
      <code>NumberModel</code>) are objects that call
      <code>send</code> (with the <code>'default'</code> event) when
      they are modified.</p>
<p>An <code>Assignee</code> (part of the <em>Anygui</em>
      Model-View-Controller mechanism) is an object that supports the
      methods <code>assigned</code> and <code>removed</code>. These
      are automatically called (if present) when the object is
      assigned to one of the attributes of an <code>Attrib</code>
      object (such as a <code>Component</code>). <code>Model</code>s
      use this behaviour to automatically call <code>link</code> and
      <code>unlink</code>, so when the <code>Model</code> is modified,
      the <code>refresh</code> method of the <code>Attrib</code> object
      is called automatically.</p>
<p>All models have a <code>value</code> attribute, which
      contains a "simple" version of its state (such as a number for
      <code>NumberModel</code>, a list for <code>ListModel</code>,
      etc.) Assigning to this attribute is a simple way of modifying
      the model in place.</p>
<p>
<b>class Application</b>
</p>
<p>To instantiate <code>Window</code>s, you must have an
      <code>Application</code> to manage them. You typically
      instantiate an application at the beginning of your
      program:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
app = Application()
# Build GUI and run application
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In some cases subclassing <code>Application</code> might
      be a useful way of structuring your program, but it is in no way
      required.</p>
<p>
<code>Application</code> has the following methods:</p>
<p>
<code><b>run</b></code>()</p>
<p>Starts the main event loop of the graphical user
      interface. Usually called at the end of the program which set up
      the interface:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
app = Application()
# Set up interface
app.run()
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
<code><b>add</b></code>(<i>win</i>)</p>
<p>Adds a <code>Window</code> to the
      <code>Application</code>, in the same way
      <code>Components</code> can be added to <code>Frame</code>s (see
      below). A <code>Window</code> will not be visible until it has
      been <code>add</code>ed to the current <code>Application</code>
      object, and that <code>Application is running</code>. When
      constructing new <code>Window</code>s after
      <code>Application.run</code> has been called, you should ensure
      that you <code>add</code> your <code>Window</code> to your
      running <code>Application</code> after all the
      <code>Components</code> have been added to your
      <code>Window</code>; otherwise, you may see them appearing and
      moving about as <em>Anygui</em> takes care of the
      layout. (Before <code>Application.run</code> is called, this is
      not an issue, since no <code>Window</code>s will be appear
      before that time.)</p>
<p>The parameter <code>win</code> can be either a single
      <code>Window</code>, or a sequence of
      <code>Windows</code>.</p>
<p>
<code><b>remove</b></code>(<i>win</i>)</p>
<p>Removes a <code>Window</code> from the application. This
      will make the <code>Window</code> disappear.</p>
<p>
<code><b>contents</b></code>
</p>
<p>A read-only property containing a tuple of the
      <code>Window</code>s the <code>Application</code> currently
      manages.</p>
<p>
<b>class Button</b>
</p>
<p>A component which, when pressed, generate a
      <code>'click'</code> event, as well as a <code>'default'</code>
      event. Thus, in the following example, both
      <code>handler1</code> and <code>handler2</code> will be called
      when the button is pressed:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
btn = Button()
def handler1(**kw): print 'Handler 1'
def handler2(**kw): print 'Handler 2'
link(btn, 'click', handler1)
link(btn, handler2)
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
<b>class CheckBox</b>
</p>
<p>
<code>CheckBox</code> is a kind of button, and thus will
      also generate <code>'click'</code> and <code>'default'</code>
      events when clicked. But in addition, each <code>CheckBox</code>
      has a Boolean attribute <code>on</code>, which is toggled each
      time the box is clicked. The state of the <code>CheckBox</code>
      can be altered by assigning to this attribute.</p>
<p>The <code>on</code> property will be automatically
      modified (as per the MVC mechanism) when the user clicks the
      <code>CheckBox</code>. This will also cause the
      <code>CheckBox</code> to <code>send</code> a <code>click</code>
      and a <code>default</code>event.</p>
<p>The <code>on</code> attribute is a useful place to use a
      <code>BooleanModel</code>.</p>
<p>
<b>class Frame</b>
</p>
<p>
<code>Frame</code> is a component which can contain other
      components. Components are added to the <code>Frame</code> with
      the <code>add</code> method:</p>
<p>
<code><b>add</b></code>(<i>comp</i>, [<i>opts</i>,] **<i>kwds</i>)</p>
<p>Adds one or more components. The parameter
      <code>comp</code> may be either a single component, or a
      sequence of components. In the latter case, all the components
      will be added.</p>
<p>The <code>opts</code> parameter containes an
      <code>Options</code> object (see below) which gives information
      about how the object should be laid out. These options can be
      overridden with keyword arguments, and all this information will
      be passed to the <code>LayoutManager</code> (see below) of the
      <code>Frame</code>, if any. This <code>LayoutManager</code> is
      stored in the <code>layout</code> property.</p>
<p>
<code><b>remove</b></code>(<i>comp</i>)</p>
<p>Removes a component from the <code>Frame</code>.</p>
<p>
<code><b>contents</b></code>
</p>
<p>This is a read-only property which contains the contents
      (a tuple of <code>Components</code>) of the
      <code>Frame</code>.</p>
<p>
<b>class Label</b>
</p>
<p>A <code>Label</code> is a simple component which displays
      a string of text. (<code>Label</code> can only handle one line
      of text.)</p>
<p>
<b>class LayoutManager</b>
</p>
<p>A layout manager is responsible for setting the
      <code>geometry</code> properties of a set of components when
      their parent <code>Frame</code> changes shape. The default
      <code>LayoutManager</code> (and the only one supplied with the
      current release) is the <code>Placer</code> (see below).
      </p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> Although Anygui 0.1
      comes only with this layout manager, more will appear in the
      future.</p>
<p>
<b>class ListBox</b>
</p>
<p>Shows a list of options, of which one may be selected. The
      <code>ListBox</code> has two special attributes:
      <code>items</code>, a sequence of items to display, and
      <code>selection</code>, the currently selected (as an index in
      the <code>items</code> sequence).</p>
<p>The <code>selection</code> property will be automatically
      modified (as per the MVC mechanism) when the user makes a
      selection. This will also cause the <code>ListBox</code> to
      <code>send</code> a <code>select</code> and a
      <code>default</code>event.</p>
<p>
<b>class Model</b>
</p>
<p>See the section on <code>Model</code> and
      <code>Assignee</code> above.</p>
<p>
<b>class Options</b>
</p>
<p>
<code>Options</code> is a very simple class. It is simply
      used to store a bunch of named values; basically a dictionary
      with a different syntax. (For more information about the
      <em>bunch</em> class, see
      <code><a href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/52308">http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/52308</a></code>.)</p>
<p>You can set the attributes of an <code>Options</code>
      object and then supply it as an optional first parameter to the
      constructors of widgets:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
opt = Options()
opt.width = 100
opt.height = 50
opt.x = 10
btn = Button(opt, y=10)
lbl = Label(opt, y=70)
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Here <code>btn</code> and <code>lbl</code> will have the
      same <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>, and <code>x</code>
      attributes, but differing <code>y</code> attributes.</p>
<p>You can also set the attributes of an <code>Options</code>
      object through its constructur, just like with
      components:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
opt = Options(width=100, height=50, x=10)
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
<code>Options</code> objects can also be used when
      supplying arguments to the <code>add</code> method of
      <code>Frame</code>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
# Assuming a Placer LayoutManager:
opt = Options(left=10, right=10, hstretch=1)
win.add(lbl, opt, top=10)
win.add(btn, opt, top=(lbl,10))
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
<b>class Placer</b>
</p>
<p>A simple but powerful layout manager. When adding
      components to a <code>Frame</code> whose <code>layout</code>
      attribute is set to a <code>Placer</code>, you can supply the
      following keyword arguments:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
left         -- the Component's left edge
right        -- the Component's right edge
top          -- the Component's top edge
bottom       -- the Component's bottom edge
hmove        -- move horizontally on resize
vmove        -- move vertically on resize
hstretch     -- stretch horizontally on resize
vstretch     -- stretch vertically on resize
direction    -- 'left', 'right', 'up', or 'down'
space        -- spacing between multiple Components
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The geometry specifiers (<code>left</code>,
      <code>right</code>, <code>top</code>, and <code>bottom</code>)
      can be set to either <code>None</code> (the default; will use
      the <code>Component</code>'s existing coordinates), a distance
      (from the corresponding <code>Frame</code> edge), a
      <code>Component</code> (will align the edge with the opposite
      edge of the given component), or a tuple
      (<em>component</em>, <em>distance</em>)
      (as with only a <code>Component</code>, except that a gap of
      size <em>distance</em> is inserted between the
      two).</p>
<p>The movement arguments (<code>hmove</code> and
      <code>vmove</code>) specify (with a Boolean value) whether the
      <code>Component</code> should be moved (horizontally,
      vertically, or both) to maintain the given distance to the
      surrounding <code>Frame</code>'s edges; the stretching arguments
      (<code>hstretch</code> and <code>vstretch</code>) specify
      whether the <code>Component</code> may be stretched to maintain
      these distances.</p>
<p>
<b>class RadioButton</b>
</p>
<p>A <code>RadioButton</code> is a toggle button, just like
      <code>CheckBox</code>, with slightly different appearance, and
      with the difference that it belongs to a
      <code>RadioGroup</code>. Only one <code>RadioButton</code> can
      be active (have its <code>on</code> attribute be a true Boolean
      value)in the <code>RadioGroup</code> at one time, so when one is
      clicked or programmatically turned on, the others are
      automatically switched off by the <code>RadioGroup</code>. Each
      <code>RadioButton</code> also has a <code>value</code>
      attribute, which should be unique within its
      <code>RadioGroup</code>. When one <code>RadioButton</code> is
      active, the <code>value</code> attribute of its
      <code>RadioGroup</code> is automatically set to that of the
      active <code>RadioButton</code>. The <code>RadioGroup</code> of
      a <code>RadioButton</code> is set by assigning the
      <code>RadioGroup</code> to the <code>group</code> attribute of
      the <code>RadioButton</code>. Setting the <code>value</code>
      attribute of the <code>RadioGroup</code> will automatically
      activate the correct <code>RadioButton</code>.</p>
<p>
<b>class RadioGroup</b>
</p>
<p>See <code>RadioButton</code> above.</p>
<p>
<b>class TextArea</b>
</p>
<p>A multiline text-editing <code>Component</code>. Its text
      is stored in the <code>text</code> attribute, which will be
      modified (according to the MVC mechanism) when the component
      loses focus. It also supports the Boolean <code>editable</code>
      property, which may be used to control whether the user can edit
      the text area or not.</p>
<p>
<b>class TextField</b>
</p>
<p>A one-line text-editing <code>Component</code>. (See also
      <code>TextArea</code>, above.) If the enter/return key is
      pressed within a <code>TextField</code>, the
      <code>TextField</code> will <code>send</code> a
      <code>enterkey</code> event.</p>
<p>
<b>class Window</b>
</p>
<p>A window, plain and simple. <code>Window</code> is a type
      of <code>Frame</code>, so you can add components to it and set
      its <code>layout</code> property etc. To make your window
      appear, you must remember to add it to your
      <code>Application</code>, just like you add other components to
      <code>Frame</code>s and <code>Window</code>s:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
win = Window()
app = Application()
app.add(win)
app.run()
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>

<h2>7. Contributing</h2>
<p>If you want to contribute to the <em>Anygui</em>
    project, we could certainly use your help. First of all, you
    should visit the <em>Anygui</em> web site at
    <code><a href="http://www.anygui.org">http://www.anygui.org</a></code>, subscribe to the developer's mailing
    list (<code>devel@anygui.org</code>) and the user's list
    (<code>users@anygui.org</code>), and try to familiarise yourself
    with how the package works behind the scenes. Then, you may either
    help develop the currently supported GUI packages, or you may
    start writing a backend of your own. Several potential backend
    targets may be found at
    <code><a href="http://starbase.neosoft.com/~claird/comp.lang.python/python_GUI.html">http://starbase.neosoft.com/~claird/comp.lang.python/python_GUI.html</a></code>.
